Data format:
* '_id' unique id of each triple in the Knowledge Graph.
* 'triple' denotes the actual triple in the Knowledge Graph
* 'triple_norm' denotes the normalized form of the triple (after lemmatization, lower casing ...)
* 'src_sentences' is the list of sentences from which the triple was extracted by Open IE algorithms.
* 'src_document' is the source document.
* 'src_domain' is the domain of the source document, labeled by NYTimes.
* 'nouns' denotes the extracted named entity mentions (noun phrases) detected in src sentences.

Note: For the context in 'nouns', we follow two principles to extract noun phrases that existed in the source sentence:
1. We remove the titles such as "Mr.", "Ms." and "President" in the noun phrases. For example, we record "Trump" instead of "Mr. Trump".
2. We assume that a fimily name in one aricle refers to only one person. For example, in the document "2018-11-16-Assange Is Secretly Charged in U.S., Prosecutors Mistakenly Reveal .txt", both "Mr. Assange" and "Assange" refer to "Julian Assange".
