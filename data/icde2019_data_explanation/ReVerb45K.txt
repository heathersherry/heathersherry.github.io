Data format:
* '_id' unique id of each triple in the Knowledge Graph.
* 'triple' denotes the actual triple in the Knowledge Graph
* 'triple_norm' denotes the normalized form of the triple (after lemmatization, lower casing ...)
* 'true_link' is the gold canonicalization of subject and object. For relations gold linking is not available.
* 'src_sentences' is the list of sentences from which the triple was extracted by Open IE algorithms.
* 'entity_linking' is the Entity Linking side information which is utilized by CESI.
* 'kbp_info' is the Knowledge-Base Propagation side information used by CESI.
* 'nouns' denotes the extracted named entity mentions (noun phrases) detected in src sentences.
